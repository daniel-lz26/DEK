Dek is a website where you and your friends can discover, share, and play music. As you listen to music on Spotify each song appears as a card in your “deck” Users can swipe cards to interact with their own music deck. You are able to connect with your friends as it will show the similar music you are listening to in your deck of cards. Our goal is to try and connect people through music.
